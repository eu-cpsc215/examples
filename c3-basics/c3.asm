; This is a function definition.
; `_main` is an identifier. It is the name of the function.
; PROC is a directive.
_main PROC              ; Begin function - main entry point

    sub rsp, 28h        ; This is an instruction. It is a `sub` instruction with a register operand and an immediate (literal) operand.

; This is a label. It is an identifier with a colon after it.
; Labels can be reference by instructions as operands. For example, a jmp instruction can
; be used to jump program execution to this point. Labels are not instructions and they
; themselves do not get encoded into the program binary output.
